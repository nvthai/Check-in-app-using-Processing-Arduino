Check-in-app-using-Processing-Arduino
=====================================

A system (harware+software) using devices base-on Arduino platform and NFC technology for check-in/out purpose.

HOW TO GET IT:

1. Use Processing IDE to build and export files *.pde into Window/Linux/OSX application (Java required). 
Application will auto find an available Serial COM Port to get signal. 

2. Use Arduino IDE to upload file *.ino to Arduino board (connect with a RC522 module)
